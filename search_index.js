It was originally developed to simulate the contextual bandit policies in the paper Alban A, Chick SE, Zoumpulis SI (2024) Learning Personalized Treatment Strategies with Predictive and Prognostic Covariates in Adaptive Clinical Trials. Although the functionality of the package is broader than that of the paper, ContextualBandits.jl is heavily influenced by the paper's model, which focuses on rewards/signals that are linear function of the contextual information and policies that learn a Bayesian linear regression model.","category":"page"}]
